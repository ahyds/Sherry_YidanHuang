# Three observable trends based on the data

  
## Favorable item

**"Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm"** is the most favorable item in the game, being the most purchased item and also the most purchase value item.


## Age differenciation

**Age group of 20-24** is the dominant player group. They are not only the biggest group taking nearly 50% of the whole studied population and they also spend most money on the game, both in aggregated purchase and average purchase amount.


## Microtransactions

Though total purchase value is considerably important, average purchase and total purchase value per player is always **a reasonably conservative amount**. The Top 5 spenders spend on average around 4$ and their personal total purchase are less than 20$. It represents the economy effect of what is called microtransactions in the video game industry.
